You can freely contribute to our github. There're many things you can do: fix bugs, add new features, make translations. Please follow several simple rules:
* **DO NOT** commit to master, use develop or create your own branch instead
* Create one issue per one bug
* Do not duplicate issues
* Specify steps to reproduce in issues
* Create one pull request per one feature
* Create one commit for one small piece of implementation
* Write simple functions. Every function must do one small thing. All actions in function must be on one abstraction level
* Use python's typing module. Specify type of return value and arguments, e.g.
```python 
def check(site: dict) -> bool:
    """Check if site is available."""
    
    pass
```
* Write pydocs if it's needed
* Write unit tests for your code (python unittest) and put it in "tests" folder
* Place copyright and licence header in top of every file, you can find example in any project source file
* Before starting pull request, run all unit tests to make sure that you did not break anything
* Add your name to list of contributors in end of this file
